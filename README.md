# speech_to_text
in this project you can convert voice to text and check the accurracy 
this is the short description "" The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with applications that require speech data as input.

We would be using the torchaudio library (pip install torchaudio==0.11.0), please carefull read this tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/speech_recognition_pipeline_tutorial.html

Next, we would ask you to perform similar analysis on a speech dataset, i.e., speechdata.zip. Unzip this folder, you would see a folder named wavs, and a file called "labels.csv", containing annotated transcripts, including the files in the wavs folder (you have more labels in labels.csv). This dataset is selected from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/, a famous speech-based application benchmark.
